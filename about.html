            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Chloe Shankland, who is originally from the Lake District, moved to Great Sankey with her partner Jon Strange 10 years ago.

                It was while on a walk last year through the village that the couple spotted a shop for sale on Huntley Street.
                
                “We saw it before I ended up giving birth to our son, Edison,” said Chloe.
                
                “I’ve always wanted to open a coffee shop, and I think Jon’s always humoured me and said, ‘one day we’ll move out to the countryside’.
                
                “I looked at it and said, ‘oh my god Jon I think that we can do it here.”

                The couple decided to wait until after Edison was born, and a few months found that the property was still for sale.
                
                Chloe, 33, and Jon, 35, decided to buy the shop and make their dreams come true by transforming the ground floor into their own coffee shop, called Number 9.
                
                “It’s something I’ve always wanted to do, ,” said Chloe.
                
                “I just love being around people, and especially since I’ve had Edison, I just want to be local and create space that people can come to.
                
                We serve breakfast, brunch and cakes as well as a wide array of hot and cold drinks.
                
                “It’s not a greasy spoon, it’s not a health kitchen, it’s a warm, welcoming place to enjoy good food and coffee. </p>
